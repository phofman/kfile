<h1>KFile</h1>

Version 1.0.1

<h2>What is KFile?</h2>

KFile is a desktop-style file manager for Blackberry Playbook running
version 2.0 of the Blackberry operating system. It uses a multi-tab
interface to allow files to be copied, moved, and deleted. Files can be
searched for by filename, and opened using the standard Blackberry 
applications. KFile also has a very simple text editor, because this is 
something notably lacking in the BB platform.

<h2>Tabs</h2>

KFile uses multiple tabs. Tabs may contain file browsers, search results,
or text files (including this manual). You can copy-and-paste files
between file browser tabs showing different folders, or copy-and-paste
text between different text editor tabs. 
There is no limit, in principle,
to the number of tabs that you can open. However, the user interface
becomes difficult to navigate with more than three or four. The
'Exit' button on the toolbar closes the current tab.
<p/>
To open a new file browser, select 'New-&gt;New browser' in any tab.  
If you do this in a file browser tab, and a folder is currently highlighted,
then the new browser will open in the highlighted folder. In all other
cases it will open in the shared folder (see 'Shared folder' below).
<p/>
When the last tab closes, KFile will exit. Using the Settings dialog
you can ask for closure of the last tab to be confirmed by the user, 
to prevent exiting the program inadvertently.

<h2>Browsing files</h2>

The file browser shows files and folders, in alphabetical order of
filename, with folders first. Double-tap a folder
to show its contents; double-tap a file to open it (if it is
of a recognized type). For both files and folders you can
alternatively use the 'Open' button
in the toolbar 
-- the PlayBook is not particularly sensitive to double-tap events.
The current folder is displayed
in the caption at the top of the browser tab.
<p/>
File size, modification date, and permissions are displayed
briefly in the status bar at the bottom of the screen whenever a
file or folder is tapped.
<p/>
The file browser supports kinetic scrolling ('flick scrolling'),
but the text editor does not, because it interferes with text 
selection.

<h2>Shared folder</h2>

The 'Home' folder is the PlayBook shared folder. This is the 
folder that contains the subfolders for  
music, videos, etc. -- the same folder you see from a desktop computer
when the PlayBook is connected via a USB cable. 
You can get to this folder at
any time by tapping the 'Home' button in any toolbar. 
The shared folder, and its subfolders, are essentially the only place
that applications can write data that other applications can see. 
Most of the rest of the filesystem is either application-specific, or
inaccessible to applications altogether.

<h2>View mode</h2>

Tapping the 'View' button on the browser toolbar cycles between the
various display modes -- list, grid with small icons, grid with
large icons. 

<h2>Creating files and folders</h2>

In the file browser, use 'New-&gt;New file' or 'New-&gt;New folder',
and enter a name. An empty file or directory will be created in
the current folder. Because none of the built-in Playbook applications
will handle an empty file of any type, the only real use for
creating a new file is to start a new text document for use with the
KFile built-in text editor.
<p/>
If you want to start a new text document, be sure to include the
extension '.txt' in the name.

<h2>Renaming files and folders</h2>

To rename, use the 'Edit-&gt;Rename'. Only one file or folder can be
renamed at a time; an error message is display if more than one
file or folder is selected.

<h2>Deleting files and folders</h2>

Select the file(s) to delete, and tap 'Edit-&gt;lDelete'. Please note
that if the selection includes folders, all the folders' contents
will be deleted. Please note also that this operation is irreversible. 

<h2>Copying and moving files</h2>

Copying and moving files uses a cut-and-paste metaphor. In the file
browser or search results tabs, select the files or folders to copy 
or move, and tap
'Edit-&gt;Copy' or 'Edit-&gt;Cut'. Then find the destination folder --
either in the same file browser tab or a different one -- and 
tap 'Edit-&gt;Paste'. A progress dialog is displayed during the
copy or move operation. By default, moving files requires you
to confirm the operation, but copying does not (since it is not
destructive of the original files). These confirmation preferences
can be changed using the Settings dialog.
<p/>
If the selection includes folders, then the folders and all their
contents will be copied or moved.
You can cancel a long copy or move operation using the 'Stop' button
on the progress dialog.
<p/>


<h2>Searching for files</h2>

Click the 'Search' button in the file browser window. The search will
include filenames whose names include the search term -- you don't have
to specify wildcards to match part of a name -- and is case-insensitive.
The search starts in the
folder currently shown in the browser -- clicking a folder name
by itself won't change the search start point. You can cancel the search
using the 'Stop' button in the progress dialog, and any matches
found so far will be left in place. Note that the number in the 
progress bar will not be meaningful -- KFile doesn't actually know
how many filenames need to be searched without actually searching them. 
<p/>
In the search results window, file paths are shown relative to the 
folder in which the search started. Showing the path this way is a 
compromise between showing just the filename -- which would be confusing
if there are matches in multiple directories -- and showing the full
path -- which would likely take up too much room on screen.
<p/>
You can copy files from the search results window. In this case, the
copy will not include any path information -- the file will be 
created in whatever folder is visible when you do the paste. 

<h2>Text editor</h2>

The text editor is very simple -- it can edit plain text files and
provides rudimentary cut/paste/copy operations.
<p/>
The text editor will be invoked whenever you select a file from
the browser whose name ends in <code>.txt</code>. You may have
other software installed that can read text files, but the 
Blackberry OS will not allow KFile to launch it; so automatically 
launching the built-in text editor is the only thing KFile can do.
<p/>
The built-in text editor is intended for small files; KFile will
attempt to load the entire file into memory for editing. 

<h2>Thumbnail support</h2>

The KFile browser tabs can display embedded thumbnails from JPEG
images. Most images captured by digital cameras have these thumbnails
embedded. KFile won't attempt to generate a thumbnail from an image that
doesn't have one, because it takes too long and uses a lot of memory.
It can be time consuming even to process embedded thumbnails if there
are hundreds of images in a single folder, so this feature can 
be turned off in the Settings dialog.

<h2>ZIP file support</h2>

KFile does not have built-in ZIP file extraction support, because this is now
provided natively by the PlayBook OS. Opening a .zip file will cause
the archive to be expanded into a directory whose name is the same as that
of the .zip file. It will also launch the built-in file browser --
this is an unavoidable side-effect of the process, where or not the
ZIP file contains any documents that the built-in browser understands.

<h2>Appearance</h2>

KFile has basic dark-screen and light-screen skins, which can be
selected from the Settings menu. The light screen looks more
desktop-like, but the dark screen will have slightly less impact
on battery life.

<h2>Limitations</h2>

The Blackberry operating system has some significant limitations, which 
make it impossible to implement true, desktop-style functionality. 
There are a number of other limitations which result from the way that
KFile is implemented, or from the Qt library which provides its 
user interface.
<p/>
1. It is not possible to launch applications other than the built-in
BB utilities. For example, if you have an EPUB book reader installed, it
would be nice to be able to launch it it if you select an EPUB file 
from the browser.  With the current BB OS, this is impossible. Support for
generic launching is supposed to be coming in the next generation 
of the BlackBerry OS.
<p/>
2. Similarly, you can't change which application is launched for a specific
file type. MP3 files will always be opened by the built-in media player, even
if you have installed another media; the
BB platform does not provide any configuration for this.
<p/>
3. You can't run multiple files. KFile allows a bunch of different files
to be selected, but other than cut/copy/delete you can't do anything
with the selection, and KFile will display an error message if you try. 
You can't, for example, send a number of MP3 files to the
media player to form a playlist -- only one file at a time can be played. 
Again, this is
a limitation of the BB platform.
<p/>
4. The text editor saves files using the default unicode encoding of the device 
-- in practice that always seems to be UTF-8.
<p/>
5. When files are moved using cut-and-paste, they are actually renamed
at the operating system level, rather than being copied and then deleted
from their original locations. 
This (rename) is hugely faster than copy-and-delete, but probably won't 
work across different filesystems. In practice, this does not seem
to be a problem. 
<p/>
6. At present, when problems are encountered when copying or moving files,
a 'Do you want to continue?' prompt is given each time. This can make it
inconvenient to do things where you might expect many such warnings, such as
merging the contents of one directory tree with another.
<p/>
7. Files can only be copied from one directory to another -- KFile won't
automatically rename files so that you can clone them in the same directory.
<p/>
8. The Blackberry OS prevents one application seeing the files of
another, even the executables. KFile does not -- indeed can not -- circumvent
the basic security of the platform. KFile does not limit the user
to browsing the standard shared directory but, outside of this directory,
an awful lot of the filesystem is inaccessible either for reading
or writing.
<p/>
9. Cancelling a file copy operation can be quite slow.  
<p/>
10. The KFile screen will rotate automatically if you rotate the tablet, but 
some of the toolbars don't fit properly in portrait mode.
<p/>
11. KFile does not distinguish between symbolic links and the files they 
reference. You can't, for example, delete a link to a file, without deleting
the file itself.
