Text encoding issues with text editor

Keyboard popup

broadcast refreshall

continue/abort on failed file delete/copy/move

cancel of file copy can be slow to respond

Can't cut/paste over filesystems
Can't merge (easily)

Only one item can be opened at a time

copy/cut from search results only copies file, not path (but this is intuitively what is expected)

new tabs

signed app different from unsigned -- different icon on navigator

symlinks

search starts in current folder

rename
